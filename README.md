  The data used in this project was downloaded in tar format and imported into a PostgreSQL local server database. 

  This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of a DVD rental business that contains 15 tables. The data analysis covered different insights on the available movies, the actors in those movies, the categories of movies, the stores,  the stores' inventory, the customers, the pricing, and other insights. 

PostgreSQL allowed for a comprehensive exploration of the data through the use of its different functions such as Joins, CTEs, Subqueries, Case...etc. The process can be examined through the SQL text file attached to this repository.
